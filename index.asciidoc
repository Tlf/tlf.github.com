This is the new home for the _TLF_ project.  This project has been taken over 
from Rein Couperus, PA0R, in 2009 by Thomas Beierlein, DL1JBE, for maintenance and further development.


.What is TLF?
_TLF_ is a curses based console mode general logging and 
contest program for amateur radio. 

It supports the CQWW, the WPX, the ARRL-DX, the ARRL-FD, the PACC and the
EU SPRINT shortwave contests (single operator) as well as a LOT MORE basic
contests, general QSO and DXpedition mode. 

It interfaces with _cwdaemon_ or _winkeyer daemon_ for morse code generation
and with your sound card for CW/VOICE keying, connects to a number of radios
via the _Hamlib_ library and has a built-in client for DX cluster connection.

[[download]]
=== Download and Installation ===

You can download the source code for the last packaged version (TLF-1.2.2)
http://www.hs-mittweida.de/tb/tlf-1.2.2.tar.gz[here]. 
It must be compiled after unpacking (see below).

.Quick install 

Tlf uses automake and autoconf for building.
Starting with TLF-1.0.0 you need pkg-config too.

Easiest way to install tlf from source is by typing:

----
cd <packagedirectory>
./configure
make
make install
----

If you want to compile the newest code from the git repo
(http://www.github.com/Tlf/tlf), please run the
following command just after download and unpack:

----
autoreconf --install
----


If you want to connect TLF to your radio, you need Hamlib support. Use the
following command before the make above to enable it:

----
./configure --enable-hamlib
----

By default _tlf_ will be installed into _/usr/local/bin_, together with the
shell-scripts in the scripts directory. Data files will be installed into
_/usr/local/share/tlf_.  If you want to change any of these paths, you can do
this with configure too, e.g. 

---- 
./configure --prefix=/usr --datadir=/usr/share 
---- 


will install tlf and scripts into /usr/bin and datafiles
into /usr/share/tlf.

If you are doing a lot of contesting in digimodes using Fldigi there is support
for reading the audio frequency via xmlrpc. Make sure to install XMLRPC-c and 
configure tlf with

---- 
./configure --enable-fldigi-xmlrpc
----
