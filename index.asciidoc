This is the new home for the _TLF_ project.  This project has been taken over

.What is TLF?
_TLF_ is a curses based console mode general logging and 
contest program for amateur radio. 

It supports numerous contests, including CQWW, WPX, ARRL-DX, ARRL-FD, PACC and the
EU SPRINT shortwave contests, and also has general QSO and DXpedition modes. 

It interfaces with _cwdaemon_ or _winkeyer daemon_ for morse code generation
and with your sound card for CW/voice keying, connects to many radios
via the _hamlib_ library, and has a built-in client for DX cluster connection.
