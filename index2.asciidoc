.What is TLF?
_TLF_ is a console (ncurses) mode general purpose CW/VOICE keyer, logging and 
contest program for ham radio. 

It supports the CQWW, the WPX, the ARRL-DX , the ARRL-FD, the PACC and the 
EU SPRINT contests (single operator) as well as a LOT MORE basic contests, 
general QSO and DXpedition mode. 

It interfaces with a the well known _cwdaemon_ morse code generator, your
sound card, a number of radios via the _Hamlib_ library and with a DX
Cluster.

[[download]]
=== Download and Installation ===

You can download the source code for the actual version (TLF-1.1.1)
http://www.hs-mittweida.de/tb/tlf-1.1.1.tar.gz[here]. It must be compiled
after unpacking (see below).

.Quick install 

Tlf uses automake and autoconf for building.
Starting with TLF-1.0.0 you need pkg-config too.

Easiest way to install tlf from source is by typing:

----
cd <packagedirectory>
./configure
make
make install
----

If you want to compile the newest code from the git repo
(http://www.github.com/Tlf/tlf), please run the
following command just after download and unpack:

----
autoreconf --install
----


If you want to connect TLF to your radio, you need Hamlib support. Use the
following command to enable it:

----
./configure --enable-hamlib
----

By default _tlf_ will be install into /usr/local/bin, together with the
shell-scripts in the scripts directory. Data files will install into
/usr/local/share/tlf.  If you want to change any of these paths, you can do
this with configure too, e.g. 

---- 
./configure --prefix=/usr --datadir=/usr/share 
---- 


will installs tlf and scripts into /usr/bin and datafiles
into /usr/share/tlf.
